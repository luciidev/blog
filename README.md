### First, let's explore the issues.

+ Performance improvement.
+ Changing the interface.

### What has been changed in terms of performance?

First, a more up-to-date website was worked on. React was used to make it one step ahead.

### Changing the interface?

A more modern and eye-pleasing design was worked on. Features that were previously unappealing to the eye were removed and a more systematic and simple design was adopted. Also, a button to switch to black/white theme was made.

### Final word

We are working every day to get better places on the website. Thank you for your attention.

 Yours sincerely,

>  Lucian, Full Stack Developer.
